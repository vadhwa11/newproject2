<h2>Patient Registration</h2>

<span class="title">Screen Overview </span><br />
<div class="clear"></div>
This screen captures the demographic details of the patients and registers the patient. 
Every patient will be given a unique number called HIN. It is a combination of Service Type/Service Status/ Service number/ Relation to the service personnel / Serial No. This number will remain constant for the lifetime of every patient in the hospital and will never be re-allotted.

If the Patient is a civilian, then the patient needs to have the higher authorityâ€™s approval to get the check up done. Without the Permission the patient is not allowed to get registered. The name of the patient will be captured in the form of First, middle and last name. The date of birth is vital information of the patient. If that information is not available, then the approximate age of the patient will be entered. <br />
<br />

The Name of spouse or relative name, contact details (address, Phone number) of the patient is captured which helps in getting the information when the Patient gets admitted to the Hospital. At the time of registration, the Patient Status will have the value "Outpatient (OP)", which will change later, according to the movement of the patient. The date and time of registration will be captured automatically with the current date and time information. 

Visit Number - The Visit Number is generated when patient requires visiting the doctor at OPD for consultation. It is an auto generated and HIN wise number. With the help of Visit number we can trace the record of one patient for every visit.  <br />
    <span class="title">HIN No. :</span><br />

	It is a system-generated number and it is a combination of Service Type, Service status, Service number, Relation to the service personnel and Serial No. For example -<br />

Service Type: Air force (01); Service status: Serving (01); Service number: 2514365214; and Relation to the service personnel: Son (05); then the HIN will be-- 010125143652140501 Where first 2 digit: Service type; second 2 digit: Service status, last 2 digit: HIN serial no.; second last 2 digit: Relation and in the middle Service no. And if, the service personnel has two son then the HIN will be- 010125143652140502 The generation of serial no. will be service number wise, and with the help of serial number we can also know the number of HIN generated for the specific Service no.
