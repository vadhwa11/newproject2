<h2>Patient Transfer Details</h2>
<hr />
<span class="title">Screen Overview </span><br />
<div class="clear"></div>
This screen allows the ward in-charge to enter the transfer of the patient from one ward to the other or to the operation theatre. The date and time of transfer will be automatically filled.
At that time the bed from which the patient is moving will become vacant and the other bed will become occupied.
If the patient is transferred and if this entry is not made then the system will assume that the transfer was temporary and will keep the status of the bed as “Occupied”. A transfer Number will be generated automatically to identify the transfer.
